# Project Name

This project was developed as part of the Code Institute's "Moments" walkthrough. Unfortunately, due to several circumstances, I was unable to complete the project. As a result, this README reflects the progress made up until this point, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

## Overview

The project was built to replicate the features and functionalities demonstrated in the "Moments" walkthrough by Code Institute. The aim was to create a responsive, full-stack application with a React frontend and a Django REST framework backend. However, due to time constraints and other factors, the project is incomplete.
