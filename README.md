# Wireframe and Project Evolution

Initially, I planned the Pixiel Station project with two main features: a **forum** and a **game library**, along with a **messaging** feature. I created wireframes using **Canva** to map out the layout and features.

![Wireframe](Documentation/images/desktop_wireframe (2).jpg)
![Wireframe](Documentation/images/desktop_wireframe (3).jpg)
![Wireframe](Documentation/images/desktop_wireframe.jpg)
![Wireframe](Documentation/images/mobile_wireframe.jpg)
![Wireframe](Documentation/images/tab_wireframe..jpg)

As development progressed, I expanded the idea into a more comprehensive **hub**. While the final site is close to the initial concept, key features were adjusted or omitted to prioritize functionality and meet deadlines. For example:
## Key Features

### 1. Post, Like, Follow, and User Profile Apps
These apps provide Pixiel Station's core social interaction features, allowing users to create posts, like content, follow other users, and manage their profiles. Built based on the Code Instituteâ€™s walkthrough project, they include basic social functionalities essential for user engagement and connection.

### 2. Game Library App
The Game Library app was designed to offer a catalog where users could add games and manage personal collections. Currently, users can add games and view the game library, but the feature to create personal collections was not completed within the project timeline. The app provides a functional, community-accessible library, with future updates planned to enhance personalization.

### 3. Forum App
Initially, the Forum app was planned to have a standard thread-and-reply structure for in-depth discussions. Due to time constraints and a learning curve with Django and React, the forum design was simplified to allow users to create a forum topic with a title and description, appearing as a direct-response format on the frontend. While functional, this diverges from the original vision, with plans for a full thread structure in future updates.

### 4. Debate Hub App
Similar to the Forum app, the Debate Hub was envisioned to support nested discussions within each debate topic. The current implementation allows users to view a list of debate topics and participate directly. Although the nested reply structure was postponed, users can still engage in discussions within each hub topic. Future updates will introduce the intended thread-and-reply model.

### 5. Newsletter App
The Newsletter app allows users to subscribe to community updates. This app was implemented fully as intended, enabling community connection without requiring major adjustments.

### 6. Messaging App (Not Functional)
The Messaging app posed significant challenges, particularly in endpoint connections, and remained non-functional at the project's close. Despite dedicated troubleshooting efforts, limited support options made resolving these issues difficult. In the future, I plan to reattempt this feature, potentially by following additional tutorials or seeking further guidance to implement a reliable messaging service.

Looking at the final product, itâ€™s rewarding to see how the project evolved from a basic **forum and game library** to a more dynamic **hub** for gaming content and community interaction. This will continue to develop as new features are added.



# Branding 

## Logo:
![Logo](Documentation/images/logopicture.jpg) 


TThe logo incorporates a joystick, representing the nostalgic retro gaming experience. The logo was redesigned to enhance clarity and visibility, ensuring the page name is easily readable. 
The original design featured a smaller font that was less legible, so the updated version uses a larger, clearer font for better user experience and a more intuitive UI 

## Colours

# Testings

### Validations

Comprehensive testing has been conducted for all React JavaScript and CSS files in the Pixiel Station frontend. Screenshots document the results, indicating whether each file has errors or is error-free. Given the number of files involved, these screenshots are stored separately in the project repository for better organization.

You can view the testing screenshots in the following directory:
[Testing Images](https://github.com/solracnauj92/pixelstationproject5/tree/main/Documentation/testingimages)

Each screenshot provides a clear record of the testing status for individual files.

### JavaScript Validation

JavaScript validation was performed using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/). Screenshots capture the results of JSHint validation for each JavaScript file, showing any detected issues or confirming that the file is error-free. This validation process helps ensure high code quality by identifying potential issues and enforcing JavaScript best practices.

### CSS Validation

CSS validation was performed using the W3C CSS Validator to verify code quality across all stylesheets. Screenshots are included for each CSS file, showing validation results to confirm compliance or highlight any errors. This process ensures that the CSS is optimized and free from errors, contributing to a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

# Responsiveness and Lighthouse Performance

To ensure that **Pixiel Station** is fully responsive across various devices and platforms, I tested the site on Chrome, Edge, and Opera browsers using both desktop and mobile devices. Due to the large file sizes of the screenshots, I have placed them in a separate folder within the project. These screenshots show how the website performs on different devices and browsers, verifying that the layout is responsive and provides a consistent experience for all users.

You can view the **Responsiveness Screenshots** and **Lighthouse Performance Reports** in the [Documentation folder](https://github.com/solracnauj92/pixelstationproject5/tree/main/Documentation/testinglighthouse).

### Lighthouse Performance

For performance testing, I used **Google Lighthouse** via Chrome Developer Tools to evaluate the website's performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. Each page was assessed, and reports were generated to ensure optimal performance. The app's goal is to be not only functional but fast and accessible to all users. 

Full Lighthouse reports and related screenshots are available in the [Documentation section](https://github.com/solracnauj92/pixelstationproject5/tree/main/Documentation/testinglighthouse) for further review.


## Technology Stack and Development Environment

### Frontend Technologies

- **React**:  
  The frontend of Pixiel Station is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of dynamic, responsive, and interactive components that enhance the overall user experience. It was used to handle interactive features such as the newsletter signup, user profiles, game library, and dynamic content updates.

- **CSS**:  
  The styling of the website has been handled using a combination of custom CSS and frameworks like Bootstrap. CSS ensures that the website is visually appealing, consistent, and responsive across different devices and screen sizes. Specific design patterns and animations were used to enhance the visual experience.

- **Bootstrap**:  
  Bootstrap was utilized to streamline the design and layout process. It helped make the website responsive and ensured that various UI components (like buttons, modals, forms, and navigation menus) work seamlessly across different screen sizes. Customizations were made to fit the design requirements of the site.

### Development Environment Issue

While developing the project, I encountered an issue with the Node.js environment that led to some challenges. Here's a summary of the issue and how I handled it:

- **Issue**:  
  Although the development server typically starts with the `npm start` command, at times it fails to work properly. To resolve this, I was prompted to install **Node.js version 18 (v18)**, and later **v16** to make the project work. This issue started occurring after I was attempting to fix a problem where the database was being forgotten after entering user details.

- **Cause**:  
  I found that in order to get things working, I had to install **Node.js v18** before **v16**, as **v16** was the version the project was ultimately functioning with. However, this process caused my dependencies to break and become inconsistent. The environment issue was never resolved.

- **Fix**:  
  The core issue was related to a new database link, rather than the development environment itself. The new link allowed the project to persist user data as expected. Unfortunately, despite efforts to resolve the environment issue, I was unable to fix the underlying problem with the Node.js versions and dependencies.

- **Resolution Advice**:  
  After consulting with my tutors, I was advised to keep the development environment as-is to avoid further complications with dependencies and the project setup. I have documented this issue here for transparency, as the project is still functional with **Node.js v16**, even though the environment setup is not ideal.

### Next Steps

If you encounter the same issue or need to replicate the environment:

1. Install **Node.js v18**.
2. Install **Node.js v16** afterward (the project works with this version).
3. If issues persist, follow the advice to keep the environment unchanged and refer to this explanation for troubleshooting.

### Bugs and Fixes

1. **Profile Edit Bug**  
   - **Issue**: Users were unable to edit their profiles, and attempts to update profiles resulted in errors.  
   - **Fix**: The issue was traced to incorrect database routing and missing field configurations. After reconfiguring the backend database settings, the profile edit feature became functional again.

2. **Login Issues after Profile Edit Fix**  
   - **Issue**: After fixing the profile edit bug, the login functionality stopped working, resulting in an error.  
   - **Fix**: The issue was resolved by adjusting the login route and ensuring proper session management in both the frontend (React) and backend (Django).

3. **Filter Not Appearing on Game Library**  
   - **Issue**: The filter functionality on the game library page wasn't appearing as expected.  
   - **Fix**: The issue was caused by incorrect binding of filter components in React. By properly linking the filter state to the UI, the issue was fixed, and the filter now appears and functions correctly.

4. **CORS Issues**  
   - **Issue**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues were preventing the frontend React app from communicating with the Django backend.  
   - **Fix**: The CORS settings were adjusted in the Django backend by configuring the `django-cors-headers` middleware to allow requests from the frontend domain.

5. **Routing Issues in React**  
   - **Issue**: Incorrect routing caused several pages to not load as expected, especially after user login or navigating between different app sections.  
   - **Fix**: After troubleshooting the routes, the issue was resolved by correcting path mappings and ensuring each route was properly linked to its corresponding component in React.

6. **Node and Babel Configuration Issues**  
   - **Issue**: The app had issues with Babel configuration, causing some React components to fail to compile correctly.  
   - **Fix**: Updated the `.babelrc` configuration to include necessary presets and ensured that the correct version of Node.js was being used (Node 16).

7. **Slow Loading Times**  
   - **Issue**: The website was taking a long time to load, especially on the game library and profile pages.  
   - **Fix**: Optimized frontend React components for better performance, reduced unnecessary re-renders, and ensured proper lazy loading of components. Additionally, backend performance was enhanced by optimizing database queries.

8. **Database Not Functional at Start**  
   - **Issue**: The backend database was not functional during the initial development stages, preventing data from being saved or retrieved properly.  
   - **Fix**: After troubleshooting the database connection and reconfiguring database settings, the issue was resolved by resetting the database URL and ensuring proper connectivity.

9. **Profile Page Stopped Working**  
   - **Issue**: After fixing previous bugs, the profile page stopped loading or displaying correctly, causing users to be unable to view or edit their profile information.  
   - **Fix**: This was resolved by revisiting the frontend and backend routing for the profile page, ensuring it was correctly linked and data was being passed between React and Django components.

10. **Client Origin Errors**  
   - **Issue**: The app was unable to correctly handle requests from the frontend due to mismatched origins between the React app and the Django backend.  
   - **Fix**: This was resolved by configuring the correct CORS settings and making sure both frontend and backend were aligned in terms of allowed origins.

## No Fixed Bugs

The following features are currently non-functional and likely require further investigation of routing, code logic, or configurations:

1. **Forum Threads and Replies**  
   - **Issue**: Threads and replies in the Forum app are not functioning as expected. The issue is likely related to incorrect routing or model configuration, which is preventing the dynamic generation of threads and replies.

2. **Debate Hub Responses**  
   - **Issue**: Responses within the Debate Hub are not appearing correctly on the frontend. This may be due to routing issues or improper view configurations preventing the correct display of responses.

3. **Game Library Collection**  
   - **Issue**: The Game Library collection feature, which allows users to group and manage games, is currently non-functional. The app is not fetching game data correctly, possibly due to issues in routing or data serialization.

4. **Messaging**  
   - **Issue**: The messaging feature is entirely non-functional. Additionally, it has caused issues on the profile page, where the `currentUser` data is not loading correctly, affecting related features on the profile page.

These issues were challenging to debug fully within the project timeframe, and additional fixes and updates are planned for future releases. Due to time constraints and the complexity of some issues, these features were not completed as intended. Additionally, there was some overriding of Bootstrap components, which further complicated UI consistency across the project.


### Future Features & Fixes

The following features are planned to be fixed or added in future updates:

1. **Forum Threads and Replies Fix**  
   - **Planned Fix**: Investigate routing and model configurations to ensure that threads and replies are dynamically generated and displayed correctly.

2. **Debate Hub Responses Fix**  
   - **Planned Fix**: Resolve routing and view configuration issues to properly display responses within the Debate Hub, with a focus on thread-like functionality.

3. **Game Library Collection Fix**  
   - **Planned Fix**: Rework data fetching and serialization in the Game Library to ensure that game collections are properly loaded and displayed for users.

4. **Messaging Functionality**  
   - **Planned Fix**: Resolve issues with the `currentUser` data not loading correctly, and fully implement the messaging feature for reliable communication between users.

5. **UI Consistency & Bootstrap Fixes**  
   - **Planned Fix**: Resolve Bootstrap overriding issues to achieve consistent and responsive UI components across all pages.

By addressing these issues, I aim to bring the application closer to the initial vision while improving the overall user experience.

## PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

## Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

## Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

## Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate 
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
